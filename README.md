jacococoveragecolumn-plugin
===========================

Plugin for Jenkins to add a column for coverage results from the JaCoCo plugin

When this plugin is installed in Jenkins, you can add a column "JaCoco Line Coverage" 
to the Dashboards which will show the latest coverage numbers from the JaCoCo plugin.

This plugin is largely based on the Emma Coverage Column plugin, see https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Emma+Coverage+Column
